### What is good design? (25 - 27)
- evaluate digital artifacts in relation to a situation
- what good is an extremely fast and efficient digital artifact if it’s not understood by it is users
- an intelligent and adaptive artifact with exceptional problem-solving capabilities is worthless if it’s too slow
- good is also defined by societal laws, regulations, agreements and contracts, and in relation to ideological considerations such as democratic, cultural, and environmental laws
- there is no simpledefinition of what good design is
- it’s a never-ending process of thoughtful reflection
- there can never be guidelines or checklists

- it also functions as a conceptional tool to create order in a chaotic
